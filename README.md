Exercise for the CodingDojo's Javascript course.  See the learning platform to see how you should improve the codes.  There are several bugs with the codes which are intentional. :)


Please work on the following features after you go through the codes and understand what's happening.

 	- There is a bug where the last character in the word doesn't show up! Please fix this error.

	- There is a bug where the space in the words do not appear correctly. For example for the word "being helpful" when it shows "being " after showing "being" the space should make the right border/cursor move a little bit to the right (to account for the space being entered by the user) yet it doesn't work correctly. Please fix this error.


// Hint: You may want to use the code below to represent space
// DON'T FORGET TO ADD "&" SYMBOL BEFORE IT
 nbsp;

The current code is creating lots of global variables; we don' t like this. 
	
	- Use what you learned about immediate functions to wrap all of this code in a single immediate function so that you don't introduce any global variables. 

	- Once done, push this to your github and show friends! Check whether the variables created (e.g. el, word_counter, etc) are not defined. 

	- Try to console.log these variables outside your immediate function).
